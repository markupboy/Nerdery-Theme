Why
===

This is basically an anti-pink theme, but with the pink added back in. It is intended to remove all the pink from the control panel  (and then reintroduce it), reduce the cartoonish rounded corners to something a bit more professional, and clean up some general alignment/padding/margin issues. It is not intended to be a huge overhaul, but instead a redux. It is a work in progress, though very usable. It will be kept light and very much in the spirit of the default theme.

Installation
============

1. Create a directory called "nerdery" inside of /themes/cp_themes and place the contents this repo inside of it. You'll then have /themes/cp_themes/nerdery/
2. Place $config['cp_theme'] = 'nerdery'; into your config.php file to ensure all users receive this theme.
